    <h1>About NebulaHub</h1>
    <p>
      NebulaHub is a personal project built and maintained by an individual developer.
      The site serves as a hub for browser-based games and other interactive content,
      all organized into one simple, easy-to-use interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of NebulaHub is to provide a clean, distraction-light experience for
      discovering and launching games and other web apps. The site itself is a static
      front-end hosted on GitHub Pages and does not run its own game servers.
    </p>

    <h2>How NebulaHub works</h2>
    <p>
      Most games and experiences on NebulaHub are loaded as standalone HTML files or
      embedded web content. Some games are created by third-party developers and are
      only linked or embedded here for convenience. Where possible, credit is given to
      the original creators or rights holders.
    </p>
    <p>
      NebulaHub does not claim ownership of third-party trademarks, game assets, or
      intellectual property. All such rights remain with their respective owners.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you are a rights holder and have questions about content shown or linked on
      NebulaHub, you can open an issue on the site’s GitHub repository or contact the
      developer using the methods listed there.
